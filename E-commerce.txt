Dear Team nano,

Our company manufactures shoes and we would like to offer our customers the option to design a shoe in 3d on our website, with all aspects of the shoe customisable.

Please refer to these two links as examples of the level of website detail and shoe customisation we are expecting from you:

NikeID - http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/product/free-run-id-running-shoe/?piid=28925&pbid=266892686#?pbid=266892686

Shoes of Prey - http://www.shoesofprey.com/3d/designer?p=CB7PP94&h=thick


You will need to build a selection process for the user to pick out the type of shoe they want based on a few variables shoe style, material colour, stitching colour, sole colour, binding colour, logo colour, label colour etc etc
The customer will then need to be able to purchase this boot through a shopping cart. At this stage, you do not need to quote on the shopping cart. Just the design customisation process.

We can provide you with the shoe styles in 3D Max
We will also provide you with the colour options and material sample swatches in JPEG, but you are to create the rest. 

Please provide undertsanding summary and your questions if any along with time eestimates for completion.
